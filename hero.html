                        <p>At the time of the interview I am referencing, Nia Asemota was just 21 years old. She has done an impressive range of things, from "collaborating with Black Girls CODE as a technical instructor, being a Game Design TA at the City College of New York’s free STEM Institute, to launching her own kids’ book about Black women engineers" (Makoni). Asemota joined her high school's robotics team in high school, and fell in love with it, but did not like that the girls were not given opportunities to practice hands-on skills. In response, she taught herself skills like coding using YouTube. Another struggle Asemota cited was finding a community in college, as she was often the only person of color in classes of up to 200 people. Inspired by her experiences as a black woman in STEM, Asemota created a coloring book, allowing children to see themselves represented in an often white, male-dominated field (Makoni). </p>
                        <p>I really enjoyed this interview, as Asemota is not just doing impressive things, but encouraging younger people to get involved in STEM. Asemota is ensuring that young people do not have to experience the isolation she felt. So much of her work revolves around getting young, black people into STEM, which is great to see in such a non-diverse field. </p>
                        <p>According to Asemota, one of her main reasons for creating her coloring book was because, "while it is important and impactful to advise underrepresented communities to explore STEM fields, it is even more powerful when you're able to be the example they need" (Asemota). As an Afro-Latina woman, Asemota often felt underrepresented, so she hopes this book, combined with her time teaching underrepresented young girls, will make the hardships of getting into STEM a little easier (Asemota). </p>
                        <p>I absolutely love how Asemota is working to make the STEM field more open for future generations. Allowing young people to see themselves in fields they are interested in is incredibly important, and Asemota is taking massive strides towards making sure young people see themselves represented. </p>
                        <p>Asemota also has two projects you can check out on her website. One program tracks stock prices and alerts the user through SMS when there is a daily rate of change of over five percent. Her other program is a Spotify time machine, which will create a playlist based on the top 100 billboard songs on the date given by the user. </p>
                        <p>Are either of these programs groundbreaking? No, but they show that Asemota is using her skills to make fun programs that many people can use. As someone who loves music, I especially find the Spotify program interesting. It seems great for when I am in the mood for a specific decade/year for music. Asemota is someone we should all keep our eyes on, as she is doing some great things!
