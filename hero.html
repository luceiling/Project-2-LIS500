                        <p class="trb">So many of the names and faces behind modern technology are kept anonymous, which can make finding marginalized people who are doing important tech work very difficult.  In all honesty I don’t have any one tech hero, but as I am being asked to come up with one for this assignment I have chosen Ifeoma Igwe, a Nigeria-born data professional and writer who shared her challenging experiences in the tech industry in an interview with People of Color in Tech (POCIT).<br>
                            <br> I really wanted to find a “tech hero” whose work included making technology more accessible for marginalized people, especially those with disabilities.  As a neurodivergent person who has spent the past 5+ years learning how to navigate the onset of chronic illness and loss of physical mobility, disability rights and activism have become immensely important to me.  With that in mind, I chose Ifeoma Igwe as my tech hero because she built a free, in-browser text-to-speech app (<a href="https://ifeomaaaa-easy-edit-app-main-huhykr.streamlit.app/">Easy Edit</a>) that can speak in a Nigerian accent.<br>
                            <br>Text-to-speech apps are critical accessibility tools as they make technology usable for people with a wide variety of needs including: blindness/other visual impairments, dyslexia, neurodivergence such as autism or ADHD that can make sight-reading text difficult or need two content formats to properly process information, physiological intolerances to screen time which can cause migraines/headaches and eye strain, and mobility limitations that might impact someone’s ability to scroll through web pages, etc.  They can also be a great assistive tool for non-disabled people who may simply learn best through audio, read slowly, or whose busy lives or long commutes do not allow them the time to read.  Text-to-speech technology can be extremely beneficial to just about anyone, but unfortunately, many quality TTS apps live behind paywalls, and/or are too robotic to be easily understood, and/or are not inclusive in the range of accents offered.  I appreciated that Igwe built her TTS app to have a Nigerian accent option; I think that’s really neat, and I wish we would see more TTS tech like that, especially in non-commercial applications and software.<br>
                            <br>While Igwe’s app does not have a lot of fancy features (you upload a .txt file, select the accent you wish to have the text read in: default or Nigerian, and it spits out an audio file which you can download), I am inspired by the fact that she is self-taught and built this app by herself.  It gives me hope that I could potentially create something similar someday, instead of doing what I do currently, which is relying on access to time-consuming to navigate TTS software through the McBurney Center or utilizing poor quality free TTS readers for my mobile device.<br>

                        <p class="trb">At the time of the interview I am referencing, Nia Asemota was just 21 years old. She has done an impressive range of things, from "collaborating with Black Girls CODE as a technical instructor, being a Game Design TA at the City College of New York’s free STEM Institute, to launching her own kids’ book about Black women engineers" (Makoni). Asemota joined her high school's robotics team in high school, and fell in love with it, but did not like that the girls were not given opportunities to practice hands-on skills. In response, she taught herself skills like coding using YouTube. Another struggle Asemota cited was finding a community in college, as she was often the only person of color in classes of up to 200 people. Inspired by her experiences as a black woman in STEM, Asemota created a coloring book, allowing children to see themselves represented in an often white, male-dominated field (Makoni). <br>
                            <br>I really enjoyed this interview, as Asemota is not just doing impressive things, but encouraging younger people to get involved in STEM. Asemota is ensuring that young people do not have to experience the isolation she felt. So much of her work revolves around getting young, black people into STEM, which is great to see in such a non-diverse field. <br>
                            <br>According to Asemota, one of her main reasons for creating her coloring book was because, "while it is important and impactful to advise underrepresented communities to explore STEM fields, it is even more powerful when you're able to be the example they need" (Asemota). As an Afro-Latina woman, Asemota often felt underrepresented, so she hopes this book, combined with her time teaching underrepresented young girls, will make the hardships of getting into STEM a little easier (Asemota). <br>
                            <br>I absolutely love how Asemota is working to make the STEM field more open for future generations. Allowing young people to see themselves in fields they are interested in is incredibly important, and Asemota is taking massive strides towards making sure young people see themselves represented. <br>
                            <br>Asemota also has two projects you can check out on her website. One program tracks stock prices and alerts the user through SMS when there is a daily rate of change of over five percent. Her other program is a Spotify time machine, which will create a playlist based on the top 100 billboard songs on the date given by the user. <br>
                            <br>Are either of these programs groundbreaking? No, but they show that Asemota is using her skills to make fun programs that many people can use. As someone who loves music, I especially find the Spotify program interesting. It seems great for when I am in the mood for a specific decade/year for music. Asemota is someone we should all keep our eyes on, as she is doing some great things!
