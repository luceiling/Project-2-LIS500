        <h3>Step 1: Planning</h3>
        <p class="reflectBody">
            We had multiple Zoom meetings to plan out the process and ideas we had. We started ambitious, thinking we could do focus on training a machine to learn biomes or seasons, but we decided that, with how broad that category could be and how diverse each area shows its seasons, it may be too difficult to do. We also wanted to use mostly our own images in the model. Lark had some photos of Minnesota wildnerness, but we would be a bit beholden to the region and seasons he had photographed. <br><br>
            But through this line of thinking, because of Lark's art, we decided that it would be interesting to explore whether AI would be able to tell the difference between art and human. We extended this a bit to "not real human" and "real human" to be a little more objective in our model.
