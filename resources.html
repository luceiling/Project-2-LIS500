                    <ul>
                        <li>We are concerned about the "practice effect" making the IAT's "game-able", or something that someone can do repeatedly to "get better at".</li>
                        <li>Could the environment and context in which one takes the IATs impact the results they get?  For example, if one were taking the IATs in a public space where others might be able to see their results, would they exercise more caution as a means of social "virtue signalling"?</li>  
                        <li>How intersectional can the IATs be, given their construction?  Even though there are many different tests, each individual test checks associations based on averages and stereotypes about one specific feature or identity of an entire group of people?  Is there even a way to consolidate the test into one that checks associations based on multiple identities at a time?</li>
                        <li>With marginalized identities being so heavily politicized in contemporary society, if someone's results show that they prefer people of marginalized identities over non-marginalized identities, is the implication then that prejudice <em>also</em> exists against non-marginalized identities (e.g. white, cisgender men)?  We find this implication to be deeply troubling because of the ease with which it could be weaponized against marginalized people.  There are countless other sources of research detailing that concepts such as "reverse racism" are perpetuated to diminish the struggles of marginalized people, and that they are objectively and blatantly harmful.
