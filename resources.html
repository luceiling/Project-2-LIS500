            <h2 class="sectionTitle">Implicit Bias Tests</h2>
                <h3 class="subsection">What are Project Implicit's Implicit Association Tests (IATs)?</h3>
                    <p>[placeholder for brief description of tests]</p>
                <h3 class="subsection">Our Reflections on the IATs &amp; Intersectionality</h3>
                    <p><b>Lark:</b> I find the bias tests to be interesting in their construction and I wonder about the legitimacy of the results (not doubt per se, this is just my curiosity).  I took a number of them a few months back as they were also mentioned in a different LIS course; at this point in my life a lot of my biases tend to favor more marginalized people as opposed to the other way around, but I don’t know what all that implies about me necessarily.</p>
                    <p>For me, intersectionality means that no one can be reduced to just one single identity, demographic, or life experience.  There are ways in which I am marginalized, and those aspects of my identity can make life more challenging sometimes.  There are also ways in which I am <em>not</em> marginalized and I do my very best to make sure I am staying aware of the ways in which I am privileged.  I think intersectionality is foundational for being able to have empathy for others, and I think identity is foundational for making sense of one’s selfhood in relation to the rest of the world, so there are both macro and micro elements embedded in the concept of intersectionality.</p>
                    <p><b>Lucy:</b> I always feel like my first reaction to the bias test is a little bit reactionary, no matter how the meter skews. I, like my compatriots, feel like there are a lot of flaws and inaccuracies in the tests. There have been times where I will take three tests in a row, where the dominant group always started out with positive connotations on the same side, so things like that seem to skew me as well. It also feels like a video game that you could eventually get good (neutral) at. But it does seem like a good way to test the implicit biases we have when done honestly.</p>
                    <p>To me, Intersectionality means that everyone is a complex, complete individual with unique experiences that shape their worlds differently than anyone else's. Each identity adds onto the other in order to  make the whole person. I feel like the IBTs do not touch on intersectionality, and do not allow for you to be able to take intersectionality into account. Disabled Black Women and treated differently than disabled white women and able bodied black women, yet there is no room for that in these tests. I feel like implicit bias can be greatly impacted by intersectionality, and some of the tests use images that show the intersectionality of a person, but only visually. I do not know how else they could do this test, though, so it must suffice.</p>
                    <p><b>Sara:</b> I was very tired when I did a lot of the bias tests, so I wonder if that impacted my results in any way. I also wonder how accurate the results were. Some of the results resonated with me, but others I felt were very off base. One of the reasons I feel the results may have been somewhat inaccurate is because I feel I would develop muscle memory in the first half, and lose it in the second half, skewing the results, though I’m sure Harvard considered that. I also took a test (not by Harvard) where I already had extreme bias, and the results were flipped, but I still got the expected result, so clearly muscle memory is not everything.</p>
                    <p>To me, intersectionality means that every person is made up of a series of identities, all of which impact their place in the world. I am a woman, which impacts how I interact with the world, and makes my life more difficult in many ways. I am also straight, cis-gender, white, middle class, and able-bodied though, which gives me a lot of privilege. All of these identities come together to influence how I interact with the world in almost every way.  I am unsure how much intersectionality impacted my results on the IBT tests. It would be interesting to see how different groups’ results differed on the tests. Everyone is made up of different identities, all of which could change IBT results, so I would assume that everyone would have different results, based on the idea of intersectionality. On the other hand, societies’ standards towards certain groups may cause all identities to skew a certain way, as society ingrains very specific standards into people.</p>
                <h3 class="subsection">Questions &amp; Critiques of the IATs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are concerned about the "practice effect" making the IAT's "game-able", or something that someone can do repeatedly to "get better at".</li>
                        <li>Could the environment and context in which one takes the IATs impact the results they get?  For example, if one were taking the IATs in a public space where others might be able to see their results, would they exercise more caution as a means of social "virtue signalling"?</li>  
                        <li>How intersectional can the IATs be, given their construction?  Even though there are many different tests, each individual test checks associations based on averages and stereotypes about one specific feature or identity of an entire group of people?  Is there even a way to consolidate the test into one that checks associations based on multiple identities at a time?</li>
                        <li>With marginalized identities being so heavily politicized in contemporary society, if someone's results show that they prefer people of marginalized identities over non-marginalized identities, is the implication then that prejudice <em>also</em> exists against non-marginalized identities (e.g. white, cisgender men)?  We find this implication to be deeply troubling because of the ease with which it could be weaponized against marginalized people.  There are countless other sources of research detailing that concepts such as "reverse racism" are perpetuated to diminish the struggles of marginalized people, and that they are objectively and blatantly harmful.
