            <img style="float: left; margin: 20px 10px 0px 75px;" src="Lark-profilepic.png" alt="Image of Lark Domka, black shirt, selfie." width="150">
            <h2>Lark</h2>
            <p class="aboutcontainer">I am in my third semester of the MLIS program, and I have an AA in Liberal Arts and a BA in Studio Art with a minor in Creative Writing. I spent the past two years working as a “Library Technician,” solo-running an academic library, which provided a lot of experience, but also a lot of burnout. Over the summer, I moved two hours across the state and was hired as a “Library Technician” at a different college, where I have a team of colleagues and a lot more mentorship opportunities. I am extremely passionate about IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility) -- I am openly transgender and multiply disabled, a community caregiver, an artist/author, haver of many interests, and chronically curious (if also chronically exhausted).
            <br><br> Insofar as LIS, I am particularly interested in instruction and information + digital literacy. I would also love to study the overlap between curiosity, autonomy/personal agency, and how libraries foster important life skills that empower people to take an interest in the world around them and navigate marginalization and social institutions that actively work against them and their survival and happiness.<br><br>Well, to be blunt, I am taking this class so that I meet my Tier DEI requirement, but intersectionality is already something I am massively passionate about, and learning coding languages and web development is something of great interest to me, so the content of the course also happens to be well within my wheelhouse. <br><br>My favorite 'tech' thing is spreadsheets! Spreadsheets are my passion!  I also very much enjoy exploring free or cost-effective and open source software alternatives. I’ve been creating digital art for over 12 years now, the vast majority of it has been made in non-commercial software.

            <h2>Lucy</h2>
            <p class="aboutcontainer"> I am in my third and final year of my MLIS program, and I got my BA in English at the University of Portland. I am originally from Sacramento, CA, I live in Portland, OR, and I work at a community college library in Vancouver, WA, where I manage interlibrary loans and wrangle student employees. I like to read, play video games, and crochet blankets for my friends. 
            <br><br> I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do until my second year in the MLIS program, where I took the XML class and realized I like doing work that challenges me and I felt compelled to continue learning more and more about how technology, coding, and UI/UX/Information Architecture fits into the Information sciences.
            <br><br> I am taking this class because I am really interested in the intersection of the tech world and the real world and how our increasingly online presence creates new ways of oppressing and uplifting us. I am also working on my coding skills. 
            <br><br>My favorite 'tech' thing is the 3DS. I think the gimmick is hilarious and it got me through a lot of growth, a lot of my life, and helped me bond with my middle school best friend, who I am still best friends with today.

            <h2>Sara</h2>
            <p class="aboutcontainer" style="margin-bottom: 50px">I am in my first semester of the MLIS program and got my BA in history at Metropolitan State University, located in St. Paul. I currently live in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, and have lived here for around nine years. Outside of class, I work as a primary care assistant but hope to get a job at a library near me. I grew up loving to read, sparking my interest in becoming a librarian, though it is a much more complicated field than it looks. My life outside of class mainly consists of listening to music, playing video games, and playing around with Rubik’s Cubes. I tend to bounce around with my interests constantly, though, so this could always change. <br><br>I am sure my interests will change as I get further into the program, but my current interests lie in public libraries. I also have some interest in youth libraries and school libraries, but I currently plan on working for a public library. I think public libraries play a vital role in their communities. They provide access to free books, computers, and a variety of useful classes. Libraries are especially important for low-income people who may not be able to afford things like Wi-Fi. <br><br>Like Lark, I am taking this class for my DEI requirement, but I am also genuinely interested in the topic. Coding is something I know very little about. I learned basic HTML during my undergrad, but that mostly consisted of me reformatting already-written HTML. I love messing around with computer files and modding video games, so coding seems very interesting to me. <br><br> My favorite 'tech' thing is video game mods. In many of the games I play, mods give them new life. I still play the Sims 2, which came out in 2004, and there are still game-changing mods coming out! I also love playing Euro Truck Simulator 2, and there are DLC-quality map mods. These are only a few examples, but mod creators are essential in the video game space.
